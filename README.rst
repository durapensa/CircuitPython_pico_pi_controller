CircuitPython library for Pi SBCs to be monitored & controlled by a microcontroller board, e.g. a Pi Pico, using i2c.


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Usage Example
=============

.. todo:: Add a quick, simple example. It and other examples should live in the
examples folder and be included in docs/examples.rst.
